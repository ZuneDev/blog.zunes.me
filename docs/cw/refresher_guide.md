Microsoft abandoned the Zune some time ago, hoping to sweep their $1 billion failure under the rug. But the community is still alive and well, and perhaps with more enthusiasm now than ever before. However, antiquated software and hardware can be difficult to use with modern machines. But I, as well as the rest of this community, are here to help.

Before I get to the basics, I'll start by mentioning that anything you may need to download during these processes is available in the other pinned post, titled Zune Archive. It contains everything from the desktop software to games and applications. It's all there and is frequently updated.

So, you're new here, and possibly to Zunes as a whole. Where do you start? You'll probably want to download the Zune desktop software. It's required to sync media files from your PC to any Zune device. It's compatible with Windows XP to Windows 10, though up-to-date versions of Win10 have been known to have issues with installation. We don't yet know what causes some people's Win10 machines to fail during installation.

Anyways, you've downloaded and installed the software. Now you might getting an update error when you connect your Zune to your PC. This means your Zune is out of date. Prior to 2014, your PC would automatically download and install the firmware update to your Zune, but without MS's support, we're on our own. Thankfully, u/kahuna900 has made our lives easier with ZuneUpdate.com. This, in tandem with my tutorial video should get your Zune updated and working properly with the software (be sure to take note of the top comment pinned on the YouTube video).

The rest is pretty self explanatory. Add your media to your Zune library and set your sync options.

Here are a few more tips for tackling other common issues:

 - Video Syncing: You'll have issues syncing videos unless they're in .wmv format, have the right bitrate, and are no more than 480p (720p for Zune HDs).

 - Zune HD Apps: This tab won't be present if you're using the Zune software on a Win10 system. Open the Zune Archive (pinned) and navigate to the Miscellaneous folder. Download and install the Zune Registry Entries. Then, navigate to the Games and Applications folder and download the Official Zune HD Apps folder to this folder on your machine: C:\Users\~username~\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Zune\Applications. Open the software and you should be good to go.
